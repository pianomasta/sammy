* Sammy

This is Sammy.

Standard input is replicated as Morse code, of one or of different [[modes][modes]].

First run with ~MORSE_KEY=yes~ to generate the [[keys][different keys or spaces]].

~MORSE_KEY=yes morse~

Standard input is a line for alphanumeric and international modes,
and the whole contents for base-95 mode.

Sammy each time writes to /tmp/out.flac or /tmp/out.spx,
and replicates for you per default.

~MORSE_SMALL=no~: /tmp/out.flac\\
~MORSE_SMALL=yes~: /tmp/out.spx

Loop a Morse /read-eval/ loop by reading lines of input.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
while true
 do morse
done
#+END_SRC

<<modes>>

** Modes

There are different modes of coding input;
namely the [[alphanumeric][alphanumeric]], for basic applications;
the [[international][international]], for a breadth of application;
and the [[base-95][base-95]], for coding technical inputs
(but what is probably uncommonly difficult to interpret by hand!).

<<alphanumeric>>

*** Alphanumeric

Alphanumeric Morse code encompasses English small letters and numerals.

~'a' . 'z'~\\
~'0' . '9'~

<<international>>

*** International

International Morse code encompasses English small letters
with the e with acute accent, numerals, and several characters,
encompassing 50 letters.

~'a' . 'z'~\\
~'00E9'~\\
~'0' . '9'~\\
~'.'~\\
~','~\\
~'?'~\\
~'0027'~\\
~'/'~\\
~'('~\\
~')'~\\
~':'~\\
~'='~\\
~'+'~\\
~'-'~\\
~'"'~\\
~'@'~

<<base-95>>

*** Base-95

Base-95 Morse code encompasses English small and capital letters, numerals,
and a large number of computing characters, encompassing 95 letters.

It uses coding strings of letters,
all stuck together for long letter-names.

~'0020' . '007E'~

<<keys>>

** Keys

Sammy uses audio files to generate strings by building them up together,
namely: dot.flac, dash.flac, es.flac, cs.flac, ws.flac.

There are element spaces, character spaces, and word spaces,
increasing such in pause or length.
And there are dots and dashes, a short and a long pulse.

The keys are generating according to the internally set [[settings][speed]],
which is lower by magnitude as it gets faster
and higher by magnitude as it gets slower.

<<settings>>

** Settings

Speed is defined internally as ~speed~,
which is lower by magnitude as it gets faster
and higher by magnitude as it gets slower.

Frequency, that of the carrier wave, is defined internally as ~frequency~,
which is the pulsations per second (Hz) or also the pitch.

Length; that of transmission generally, or of one pulse;
is defined internally as the relation of the above two as shown:

~1 รท frequency ร speed~

** Dependencies

It depends on FFmpeg and SoX,
and FFmpeg requires libspeex for the ~MORSE_SMALL~ option.
